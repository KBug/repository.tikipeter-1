# Attention:
I have some important code that I need to attend to. So far I have made about 4 updates in the last couple of days trying to get the addon to a place where everything is working so I can jump into the difficult code I need to sort out. Because there is Issue after Issue being opened, I'm closing the issues tab until I can get this code done.

Issues will reopen after that.


# Rules for Reporting Issues

* **TMDbHelper** and/or library playback issues are *not supported*. Fen does not support TMDbHelper. If I wanted to write an addon to purely search and play back results whilst another addon is used for everything else, that's what I would have written. The full breaking of TMDbHelper accessing Fen scraping & playback is close. Don't push that by opening an Issue related to it. Use a Fen fork if you want to use TMDbHelper.
* **FireStick** Issues arising from using a FireStick will no longer be supported. These devices are TERRIBLE for Kodi usage, and they present unique and sometimes irredeemable problems when they are used as a Kodi device. If I deem your Issue is due to using one of these FireSticks, then I am not willing to outlay any more of my time troubleshooting these wretched devices.
* **Pre-made Builds** of any kind are *not supported*. If you installed someone else's build, you need to go to them to troubleshoot issues. I'm sure they researched exactly how Fen works before offering it within their publicly released build without permission.
* **The squeeky wheel does NOT get the grease here.** At least not anymore.
* Error related Issues **MUST** include a log file. Your Issue will be closed immediately if there is no log file included.
* You must check all open Issues to see if your problem is being addressed already.
* **DO NOT** hijack an open issue with unrelated problems. Open a new Issue.
* It is your job to monitor the Issue you have opened. If I need additional information and it is not supplied, I will close the Issue.
* If your Issue is Trakt related, you **MUST** have observed this behavior for at least 48 hours before posting an Issue here. Trakt has a fragile API that often doesn't perform for small periods of time.
